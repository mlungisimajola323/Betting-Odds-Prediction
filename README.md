# Betting-Odds-Prediction
Using a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) to predict soccer betting odds 

# PGM Prediction Technique
Use dependencies between variables
Use causal interdepedent relationships between variables

# Varibales and Methodology

1. Identify the outcome you are predicting (home win,
draw, away win).
2. Determine the features required for the model. 6 features
are used for the model:

### Team’s average player rating: 
If individual players in a team are good, this boosts the overall team’s player
rating. In the above Kaizer Chiefs against Manchester
United example, Manchester United is competing in best
league, it has the best individual players by far compared
to Kaizer Chiefs 
### League division: 
In all countries there is a hierarchy in soccer league divisions. Division 1 is the most elite level
where best teams play. Division 2 is lower than division
1, teams that play in division 2 are not as good as those
who play in division 1

 ### League Position: 
 Each division has between 15 and 20 teams competing in it. A team that is number 1 is the
best team in the division. Having a team that is number
1 playing against a team that is number 15, the odds
would typically favour the team that is number 1. • Home/Away Team: In soccer there is something called
home advantage. Usually a team playing in the home
stadium has an advantage over the away team.

### Team’s Form: 
Given a previous number of games, it is easy to see the performance of the team. A team that is
on a number of win streaks, would typically have a better
team form.

### Head to Head: 
Two teams that are not playing for the first time have history performance when playing against
each other. It can be seen from head to head performances
which teams tends to win

### Injuries and Suspensions: 
In soccer, a player can get injured, which subsequently causes a player to miss some
matches. Also, a player may get suspended, that is when
a player get a 1 match suspension for misconduct or foul
play.
