# Betting-Odds-Prediction
Using a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) to predict soccer betting odds 

# PGM Prediction Technique
Use dependencies between variables
Use causal interdepedent relationships between variables

# Varibales and Methodology

1. Identify the outcome you are predicting (home win,
draw, away win).
2. Determine the features required for the model. 6 features
are used for the model:

• Team’s average player rating: If individual players in
a team are good, this boosts the overall team’s player
rating. In the above Kaizer Chiefs against Manchester
United example, Manchester United is competing in best
league, it has the best individual players by far compared
to Kaizer Chiefs \\
• League division: In all countries there is a hierarchy in
soccer league divisions. Division 1 is the most elite level
where best teams play. Division 2 is lower than division
1, teams that play in division 2 are not as good as those
who play in division 1
• League Position: Each division has between 15 and 20
teams competing in it. A team that is number 1 is the
best team in the division. Having a team that is number
1 playing against a team that is number 15, the odds
would typically favour the team that is number 1.
